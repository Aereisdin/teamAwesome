                            As you start out in your coding adventure, you're going to start with HTML more than likely. 
                            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the structure of web browsers. 
                            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and script languages such as JavaScript. 
                            Below are examples of the basic tags that are used in HTML pages.
                        </p>
                </section>
        </div>
        <div id="html-tags" class="html-tags"></div>
            <img src="" alt="" class="">
                <section>
                    <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
                        <p>
                            Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. 
                            HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements <b>h</b> and 1-6. 
                            The smaller the number, the larger the text will be. 
                            While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.
                        </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Paragraph Tag</h4>
                        <p>
                            The <b>p</b> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <b>"p"</b> and a closing <b>"/p"</b> tag
                        </p>
