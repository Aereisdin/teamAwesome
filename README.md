## Building as a TEAM

This is the first group project that our bootcamp cohort worked on together. It was an assignment to create an application in teams of four or so. 

It was a great experience and we learned so much together! 

Our team members on this project were:

[Indervir Singh](https://github.com/indervirsingh)

[Larry Jenkins](https://github.com/larrygjenkins)

[Matthew Webb](https://github.com/MWebb2321)

[Kiel Sprague](https://github.com/Aereisdin)

## Facing Challenges and Moving Forward

There are many issues that can come up on a group project. You can find yourself at a loss as to what to create, how to implement what you wish to make and/or who is in charge of what. Very early on our team dynamic started off smoothly, a team committee working toward consensus.

The work was divided fairly evenly based on time and areas of interest.

This was the first time our team members had worked in a group setting, so one of the major challenges we faced was overcoming merge conflicts in GitHub. Luckily these types of issues were rare, but they did occur often enough to give us a solid understanding of how to address them.

## What is Web Dev Redemption?

Web Dev Redemption is an application created to help brand new developers get started. It includes:   

1. Links to Development Resouces
2. Everyday Explanations of Coding Jargon
3. Working Examples of Code

These are the main ideas that encapsulate what we were striving to create while working within the time constraints of the assignment. 

## What is the Vision of the Future?

In an ideal setting, we would continue to build out this application with more resources, working examples and explanations to help new developers. Future iterations would also include a job search feature.
